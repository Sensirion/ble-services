        How to use the service:

          #. To be able to calculate how many samples we have missed; the sampling interval has to be readout.

          #. The measuring device returns the sampling interval in milliseconds.

          #. Then we check how many samples are available at all.

          #. The measuring device returns the number of available samples.

          #. Based on the retrieved information, we determine how many samples we want to read. If the requested
             number of samples is higher than the available number of samples, then all available samples are
             transmitted.

             If the requested number of samples is less than the available number of samples, the oldest samples are
             omitted. If the requested number of samples is not specified, then all available samples are transmitted.

        The steps 1 to 5 are optional, they are only required if not all samples should be transferred by the Data Logger.
        This is useful if older samples have already been read from the logger and only the missing new samples are to
        be transferred.
