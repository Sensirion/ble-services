      uuid: 00008000-b38d-4985-720e-0f993a68ee41
      description: Service to control the data logging on a measuring device.
      application-note: |
        The Smart Humigadget (a.k.a SHT3x Gadget) does not support the data logger service.
        Documentation for the SHT3x Gadget can be found here:
        https://sensirion.com/media/documents/429F0DF6/61643DC1/Sensirion_Humidity_Sensors_SHT3x_Smart-Gadget_User-Guide_1.pdf

        How to use the service:

          #. To be able to calculate how many samples we have missed; the sampling
             interval has to be readout.

          #. The measuring device returns the sampling interval in milliseconds.

          #. Then we check how many samples are available at all.

          #. The measuring device returns the number of available samples.

          #. Based on the retrieved information, we determine how many samples we want to read.
             If the requested  number of samples is higher than the available number of samples, then all available samples are transmitted.

             If the requested number of samples is less than the available number of samples, the oldest samples are
             omitted. If the requested number of samples is not specified, then all available samples are transmitted.

        The steps 1 to 5 are optional, they are only required if not all samples should be transferred by the Data Logger.
        This is useful if older samples have already been read from the logger and only the missing new samples are to
        be transferred.
